      "abstract": "Long-tailed learning is considered to be an extremely challenging problem in data imbalance learning. It aims to train well-generalized models from a large number of images that follow a long-tailed class distribution. In the medical field, many diagnostic imaging exams such as dermoscopy and chest radiography yield a long-tailed distribution of complex clinical findings. Recently, long-tailed learning in medical image analysis has garnered significant attention. However, the field currently lacks a unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often leads to unfair comparisons and inconclusive results. To help the community improve the evaluation and advance, we build a unified, well-structured codebase called Medical OpeN-source Long-taIled ClassifiCAtion (MONICA), which implements over 30 methods developed in relevant fields and evaluated on12 long-tailed medical datasets covering 6 medical domains. Our work provides valuable practical guidance and insights for the field, offering detailed analysis and discussion on the effectiveness of individual components within the inbuilt stateof-the-art methodologies. We hope this codebase serves as a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark, encouraging further advancements in long-tailed medical image learning. The codebase is publicly available on https://github.com/ PyJulie/MONICA.",

      "authors": "Eva Pachetti and Sara Colantonio",
      "year": "2024",
      "venue": "Artificial Intelligence in Medicine",
      "abstract": "The lack of annotated medical images limits the performance of deep learning models, which usually need large-scale labelled datasets. Few-shot learning techniques can reduce data scarcity issues and enhance medical image analysis speed and robustness. This systematic review gives a comprehensive overview of few-shot learning methods for medical image analysis, aiming to establish a standard methodological pipeline for future research reference. With a particular emphasis on the role of meta-learning, we analysed 80 relevant articles published from 2018 to 2023, conducting a risk of bias assessment and extracting relevant information, especially regarding the employed learning techniques. From this, we delineated a comprehensive methodological pipeline shared among all studies. In addition, we performed a statistical analysis of the studies’ results concerning the clinical task and the meta-learning method employed while also presenting supplemental information such as imaging modalities and model robustness evaluation techniques. We discussed the findings of our analysis, providing a deep insight into the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods and the most promising approaches. Drawing on our investigation, we yielded recommendations on potential future research directions aiming to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.",
