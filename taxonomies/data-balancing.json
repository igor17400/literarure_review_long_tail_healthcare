Researchers have turned to generative deep learning techniques alongside signal processing to augment existing data and improve cardiac auscultation classification models.

Robustness, in this case, is defined as both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance by measures such as Matthew's correlation coefficient. One contribution of this work is to show that more robust abnormal heart sound classifiers can be trained using an augmented dataset. The augmented dataset includes both signal processing techniques and synthetic phonocardiograms conditionally generated using the WaveGrad and DiffWave diffusion models an approach that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work of its kind. The efficacy of the proposed data augmentation approach is evaluated on an example convolutional neural network, trained on the original and augmented data. It is found that both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance can be improved over various datasets for neural networks trained with this augmented dataset. Results show significant performance improvements. Specifically, in-distribution accuracy, balanced accuracy, and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) increased by 2.5%, 4.1%, and 0.066, respectively. The greatest out-of-distribution improvements were observed on one dataset, where accuracy, balanced accuracy, and MCC increased by 43.1%, 20.2%, and 0.297, respectively.

      "abstract": "A data-driven prediction tool has the potential to provide early warning of an asthma attack and improve asthma management and outcomes. Most previous machine learning (ML)-based studies for asthma attack prediction have reported a severe class imbalance, with major implications for model performance. We aimed to undertake a systematic comparison of several class imbalance handling techniques in the context of risk prediction models for asthma prognosis. We used data from 9,835 asthma patients extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database and deployed five class imbalance handling methods based on synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and cost function customisation. We then compared their performances in improving two-class classifier models developed using logistic regression (LR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for three different prediction tasks with varying severity of class imbalance (proportion of majority class ranging from 90.86% to 98.98%). The cost function customisation technique substantially outperformed the SMOTE-based methods in all tasks. XGBoost combined with cost function customisation achieved the highest prediction performance for the outcome with the most extreme class imbalance ratio (AUC = 0.72). Our findings suggest that the cost function customisation-based approach to tackle class imbalance provides substantially better performance compared to oversampling in the context of asthma management.Clinical Relevance- This study underscores the challenge of class imbalance in the context of prediction tools to improve asthma management and outcomes and provides a methodological solution that addresses the challenge. Accurate asthma prediction tools can provide early warning and potentially prevent deterioration thereby improving the quality of life of patients with asthma.",

      "abstract": "Highly imbalanced datasets are ubiquitous in medical image classification problems. In such problems, it is often the case that rare classes associated to less prevalent diseases are severely under-represented in labeled databases, typically resulting in poor performance of machine learning algorithms due to overfitting in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for sampling training data based on the popular MixUp regularization technique, which we refer to as Balanced-MixUp. In short, Balanced-MixUp simultaneously performs regular (i.e., instance-based) and balanced (i.e., class-based) sampling of the training data. The resulting two sets of samples are then mixed-up to create a more balanced training distribution from which a neural network can effectively learn without incurring in heavily under-fitting the minority classes. We experiment with a highly imbalanced dataset of retinal images (55K samples, 5 classes) and a long-tail dataset of gastro-intestinal video frames (10K images, 23 classes), using two CNNs of varying representation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Balanced-MixUp outperforms other conventional sampling schemes and loss functions specifically designed to deal with imbalanced data.

      "abstract": "ost of the medical tasks naturally exhibit a long-tailed distribution due to the complex patient-level conditions and the existence of rare diseases. Existing long-tailed learning methods usually treat each class equally to re-balance the long-tailed distribution. However, considering that some challenging classes may present diverse intra-class distributions, re-balancing all classes equally may lead to a significant performance drop. To address this, in this paper, we propose a curriculum learning-based framework called Flexible Sampling for the long-tailed skin lesion classification task. Specifically, we initially sample a subset of training data as anchor points based on the individual class prototypes. Then, these anchor points are used to pre-train an inference model to evaluate the per-class learning difficulty. Finally, we use a curriculum sampling module to dynamically query new samples from the rest training samples with the learning difficulty-aware sampling probability. We evaluated our model against several state-of-the-art methods on the ISIC dataset. The results with two long-tailed settings have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed training strategy, which achieves a new benchmark for long-tailed skin lesion classification.",
