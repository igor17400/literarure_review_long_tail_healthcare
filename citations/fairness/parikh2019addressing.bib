  abstract={Recent scrutiny of artificial intelligence (AI)–based facial recognition software has renewed concerns about the unintended effects of AI on social bias and inequity. Academic and government officials have raised concerns over racial and gender bias in several AI-based technologies, including internet search engines and algorithms to predict risk of criminal behavior. Companies like IBM and Microsoft have made public commitments to “de-bias” their technologies, whereas Amazon mounted a public campaign criticizing such research. As AI applications gain traction in medicine, clinicians and health system leaders have raised similar concerns over automating and propagating existing biases.1 But is AI the problem? Or can it be part of the solution? While potentially inadvertently contributing to bias, AI technologies, when used responsibly, may also help counteract the risk of bias in unique ways. Using AI to identify bias in health care may help identify interventions that could help correct biased clinician decision-making and possibly reduce health disparities.}
