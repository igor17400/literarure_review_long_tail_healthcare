  abstract={Supervised machine learning models have been widely used to predict and get insight into diseases by classifying patients based on personal health records. However, a class imbalance is an obstacle that disrupts the training of the models. In this study, we aimed to address class imbalance with a conditional normalizing flow model, one of the deep-learning-based semi-supervised models for anomaly detection. It is the first introduction of the normalizing flow algorithm for tabular biomedical data.}
