  abstract={Highly imbalanced datasets are ubiquitous in medical image classification problems. In such problems, it is often the case that rare classes associated to less prevalent diseases are severely under-represented in labeled databases, typically resulting in poor performance of machine learning algorithms due to overfitting in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for sampling training data based on the popular MixUp regularization technique, which we refer to as Balanced-MixUp. In short, Balanced-MixUp simultaneously performs regular (i.e., instance-based) and balanced (i.e., class-based) sampling of the training data. The resulting two sets of samples are then mixed-up to create a more balanced training distribution from which a neural network can effectively learn without incurring in heavily under-fitting the minority classes. We experiment with a highly imbalanced dataset of retinal images (55K samples, 5 classes) and a long-tail dataset of gastro-intestinal video frames (10K images, 23 classes), using two CNNs of varying representation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Balanced-MixUp outperforms other conventional sampling schemes and loss functions specifically designed to deal with imbalanced data.
