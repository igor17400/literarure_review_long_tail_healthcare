abstract = {The lack of annotated medical images limits the performance of deep learning models, which usually need large-scale labelled datasets. Few-shot learning techniques can reduce data scarcity issues and enhance medical image analysis speed and robustness. This systematic review gives a comprehensive overview of few-shot learning methods for medical image analysis, aiming to establish a standard methodological pipeline for future research reference. With a particular emphasis on the role of meta-learning, we analysed 80 relevant articles published from 2018 to 2023, conducting a risk of bias assessment and extracting relevant information, especially regarding the employed learning techniques. From this, we delineated a comprehensive methodological pipeline shared among all studies. In addition, we performed a statistical analysis of the studies’ results concerning the clinical task and the meta-learning method employed while also presenting supplemental information such as imaging modalities and model robustness evaluation techniques. We discussed the findings of our analysis, providing a deep insight into the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods and the most promising approaches. Drawing on our investigation, we yielded recommendations on potential future research directions aiming to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.}
