  abstract={In the last decade, long-tail learning has become a popular research focus in deep learning applications in medicine. However, no scientometric reports have provided a systematic overview of this scientific field. We utilized bibliometric techniques to identify and analyze the literature on long-tailed learning in deep learning applications in medicine and investigate research trends, core authors, and core journals. We expanded our understanding of the primary components and principal methodologies of long-tail learning research in the medical field.}
