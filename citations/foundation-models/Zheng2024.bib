  abstract={Developing a generalist radiology diagnosis system can greatly enhance clinical diagnostics. In this paper, we introduce RadDiag, a foundational model supporting 2D and 3D inputs across various modalities and anatomies, using a transformer-based fusion module for comprehensive disease diagnosis. Due to patient privacy concerns and the lack of large-scale radiology diagnosis datasets, we utilize high-quality, clinician-reviewed radiological images available online with diagnosis labels. Our dataset, RP3D-DiagDS, contains 40,936 cases with 195,010 scans covering 5568 disorders (930 unique ICD-10-CM codes). Experimentally, our RadDiag achieves 95.14% AUC on internal evaluation with the knowledge-enhancement strategy. Additionally, RadDiag can be zero-shot applied or fine-tuned to external diagnosis datasets sourced from various medical centers, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In conclusion, we show that publicly shared medical data on the Internet is a tremendous and valuable resource that can potentially support building strong models for image understanding in healthcare.}
